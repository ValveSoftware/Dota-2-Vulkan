# Dota-2-Vulkan
Tracker for issues specific to the Vulkan version of Dota 2 on Windows, Linux and macOS.

Notes:

* This tracker is only for issues impacting the Vulkan version of Dota 2.  For non-Vulkan Dota 2 Linux/macOS issues please use https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Dota-2.  For all other Dota 2 bugs, use http://dev.dota2.com/.
* Before filing a bug, please make sure your system meets the minimum requirements and you have a supported driver installed.
* Please make sure to opt-in to the Steam Client Beta for the latest Steam Vulkan Overlay (fixes performance issue with Steam Overlay) 
* Enable with the -vulkan launch option after downloading the Vulkan Beta DLC or choose "Vulkan" in the Video Options (requires restart of game).  Remove -dx9/-dx11/-gl (if present) from any previous launch options. You will know if you're properly running Vulkan if Vulkan-specific commands are available in the console, such as 'vulkan_memgr_print'
* Minimum requirements for Dota 2 Vulkan:
    * Windows 7/8/10 64-bit: NVIDIA Kepler-series+ (365.19+ driver), AMD 7700+ (Crimson 16.5.2.1+ driver)
    * Linux 64-bit: NVIDIA Kepler-series+ (364.16+ driver), AMD GCN 1.2 (16.20.3 driver)
    * macOS 10.13.4+ with a Metal-capable GPU
    * __NOTE: NVIDIA's driver does not support Vulkan on Fermi GPUs__, this includes some low end models in the 600/700/800 series, so please make sure you have a Kepler (GKxxx), Maxwell (GMxxx), or Pascal (GPxxx) GPU before posting a bug.  This is especially confusing because some models such as the GT730 have both a Fermi and Kepler model.  You can check for sure by looking up your [NVIDIA PCI Device ID] (https://pci-ids.ucw.cz/read/PC/10de).  The Device ID can be found in ```Steam``` -> ```Help``` -> ```System Information```.
    * 2GB of GPU Memory required - may experience crashes with < 2GB of GPU memory.

If the game fails to launch with a "missing executable" error, please use Steam to [verify the integrity](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2037-QEUH-3335) of the game's files in order to acquire the missing binaries.

Known Issues
------------

* The first time you run with Vulkan you may experience short stutters while the engine caches shaders on disk. After playing through or watching a match, these stutters should go away.

Conduct
-------

There are basic rules of conduct that should be followed at all times by everyone participating in the discussions.  While this is generally a relaxed environment, please remember the following:

- Do not insult, harass, or demean anyone.
- Do not intentionally multi-post an issue.
- Do not use ALL CAPS when creating an issue report.
- Do not repeatedly update an open issue remarking that the issue persists.

Remember: Just because the issue you reported was reported here does not mean that it is an issue with Dota 2 Reborn.  As well, should your issue not be resolved immediately, it does not mean that a resolution is not being researched or tested.  Patience is always appreciated.

Reporting Issues
----------------

If you encounter a bug while using Dota 2 Vulkan, first search the [issue list](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Dota-2-Vulkan/issues) to see if it has already been reported. Include closed issues in your search.

If it has not been reported, create a new issue with at least the following information:

- what platform this is occurring  on: Linux or Windows 7/8/10;
- a short, descriptive title;
- a detailed description of the issue, including any output from the command line;
- steps for reproducing the issue; and
- your [system information](#system-information).

Please place logs either in a code block (press `M` in your browser for a GFM cheat sheet) or a [gist](https://gist.github.com).

### System information

Your system information must include:
- your Linux distro or Windows version
- if Linux, your Desktop/Window Manager
- your Graphics card info (manufacturer, card version), any and all graphics driver versions
- anything else that you think may be useful (mouse/keyboard, filesystem type, etc).

The preferred and easiest way to get this information is from Steam's Hardware Information viewer from the menu (`Help -> System Information`).

Once your information appears: right-click within the dialog, choose `Select All`, right-click again, and then choose `Copy`.
Paste this information into your report, preferably in a code block or a [gist](https://gist.github.com).

Feature Requests
-------------------

This repository is not meant for Dota 2 feature requests. There are forums dedicated to general Dota 2 discussion at http://dev.dota2.com.
